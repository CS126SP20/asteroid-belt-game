# [Travel Through the Asteroid Belt!]

Author: [Amish Dara]

  The project that I intend to create is a single-player 2D game that 
  involves travelling through the Asteroid Belt. My motivation for this project
   stems from my interest in space and the celestial bodies above us. In regards
    to programming, I've always been interested in graphics and I aim to leverage Cinder 
    and some C++ libraries to create 2D graphics for this game. I've created games that have
    involved graphics before but not to the extent that I forsee for this project. This is a 
    benefit because this is a motivation factor and it also allows me to learn a lot about 
    something that I'm interested in.
  
  
  The game will involve multiple levels with ascending difficulties. The 
  primary obstacle that the user faces are the asteroids and lasers that are 
  thrown at them. They will have to dodge these obstacles. Most of 
  the functionality will be centered around the W, A, S, D, up key, down key, left key, 
  right key, and space bar. I also intend to use multiple libraries, mostly for image
   processing and 2D graphics. Some of these libraries include Blend 2D 
   (https://github.com/blend2d/blend2d), GD Graphics Library (https://github.com/libgd/libgd),
    and ITK (https://itk.org/). Some stretch goals that I would work on if I finish early would 
    be to make this game multi-player and add a storyline.
  
  
  By the end of week 1, I would aim to have all the screens 
  planned out. I would also want to create the header files, directories, and necessary 
  classes. By week 2, I would want to do a lot of the back end implementations for the project.
   By the end of the final week I would like to implement the front end graphics and work on 
   stretch goals if possible.
